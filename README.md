----

The aim of this project is to serve as a simple example of implementing a model in tensorflow.

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure to have setuptools library installed on python

2. Using version 3.6+ of python


### Description of Model

Its a simple fully connected neural network model (preceptron) with hyperparameters.json showing the hyperparameter values


**Note**:
Since this is a simple example, data is fed to the tensorflow model an array that was pre-loaded into memory.
in case you are using python3.7 then install tensorflow in the following way:

```
pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.8.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
